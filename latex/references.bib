	abstract = {We analyze a {\textasciitilde}70 ksec Chandra ACIS-I exposure of the globular cluster Omega Centauri (NGC 5139). The {\textasciitilde}17 amin x 17 amin field of view fully encompasses three core radii and almost twice the half-mass radius. We detect 180 sources to a limiting flux of {\textasciitilde}4.3x10{\textasciicircum}-16 erg/cm{\textasciicircum}2/s (Lx = 1.2x10{\textasciicircum}30 erg/s at 4.9 kpc). After accounting for the number of active galactic nuclei and possible foreground stars, we estimate that 45-70 of the sources are cluster members. Four of the X-ray sources have previously been identified as compact accreting binaries in the cluster--three cataclysmic variables (CVs) and one quiescent neutron star. Correlating the Chandra positions with known variable stars yields eight matches, of which five are probable cluster members that are likely to be binary stars with active coronae. Extrapolating these optical identifications to the remaining unidentified X-ray source population, we estimate that 20-35 of the sources are CVs and a similar number are active binaries. This likely represents most of the CVs in the cluster, but only a small fraction of all the active binaries. We place a 2-sigma upper limit of Lx {\textless} 3x10{\textasciicircum}30 erg/s on the integrated luminosity of any additional faint, unresolved population of sources in the core. We explore the significance of these findings in the context of primordial vs. dynamical channels for CV formation. The number of CVs per unit mass in Omega Cen is at least 2-3 times lower than in the field, suggesting that primordial binaries that would otherwise lead to CVs are being destroyed in the cluster environment.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the measurement of the neutron star (NS) radius using the thermal spectra from quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs) inside globular clusters (GCs). Recent observations of NSs have presented evidence that cold ultra dense matter – present in the core of NSs – is best described by “normal matter” equations of state (EoSs). Such EoSs predict that the radii of NSs, RNS, are quasi-constant (within measurement errors, of ∼ 10\%) for astrophysically relevant masses (MNS {\textgreater} 0.5 M⊙). The present work adopts this theoretical prediction as an assumption, and uses it to constrain a single RNS value from ﬁve qLMXB targets with available high signal-to-noise X-ray spectroscopic data. Employing a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo approach, we produce the marginalized posterior distribution for RNS, constrained to be the same value for all ﬁve NSs in the sample. An eﬀort was made to include all quantiﬁable sources of uncertainty into the uncertainty of the quoted radius measurement. These include the uncertainties in the distances to the GCs, the uncertainties due to the Galactic absorption in the direction of the GCs, and the possibility of a hard power-law spectral component for count excesses at high photon energy, which are observed in some qLMXBs in the Galactic plane. Using conservative assumptions, we found that the radius, common to the ﬁve qLMXBs and constant for a wide range of masses, lies in the low range of possible NS radii, RNS = 9.1+−11..35 km (90\%-conﬁdence). Such a value is consistent with low-RNS equations of state. We compare this result with previous radius measurements of NSs from various analyses of diﬀerent types of systems. In addition, we compare the spectral analyses of individual qLMXBs to previous works.},

	abstract = {We report on the detailed modeling of the X-ray spectra of three likely neutron stars. The neutron stars, observed with XMM-Newton, are found in three quiescent X-ray binaries in the globular clusters: ! Cen, M13, and NGC 2808. Whether they are accreting at very low rates or radiating energy from an accretion-heated core, their X-ray spectra are expected to be those of a hydrogen atmosphere. We use and compare publicly available hydrogen atmosphere models with constant and varying surface gravities to constrain the masses and radii of the neutron stars. Thanks to the high XMM-Newton throughput and the accurate distances available for these clusters, using the latest science analysis software release and calibration of the XMM-Newton EPIC cameras, we derive the most stringent constraints on the masses and radii of the neutron stars obtained to date from these systems. A comparison of the models indicates that previously used hydrogen atmosphere models (assuming constant surface gravity) tend to underestimate the mass and overestimate the radius of neutron stars. Our data constrain the allowed equations of state to those which concern normal nucleonic matter and one possible strange quark matter model, thus constraining radii to be from 8 km and masses up to 2.4 M .},

We carefully consider a number of systematic problems, and show that the choices of atmospheric composition, interstellar medium abundances, and cluster distances can have important effects on the inferred NS mass and radius. We ﬁnd that for typical NS masses, the radii of both NSs are consistent with the 10−13 km range favoured by recent nuclear physics experiments. This removes the evidence suggested by Guillot and collaborators for an unusually small NS radius, which relied upon the small inferred radius of the NGC 6397 NS.},

	abstract = {We report on a deep XMM-Newton EPIC observation of the globular cluster Omega Cen performed on August 13th, 2001. We have detected 11 and 27 faint X-ray sources in the core and half mass radii, searching down to a luminosity of 1.3 × 1031 ergs s−1 in the 0.5–5 keV range. Most sources have bolometric X-ray luminosities between ∼1031−1032 ergs s−1. We present the color-color and hardness-intensity diagrams of the source sample, as well as high-quality EPIC spectra of the brightest objects of the ﬁeld, including the two candidate Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) in the core and the quiescent neutron star low-mass X-ray binary candidate. The spectra of the latter objects fully support their previous classiﬁcation. We show that the bulk of sources are hard and spectrally similar to CVs. The lack of soft faint sources might be related to the absence of millisecond pulsars in the cluster. The XMM-Newton observations reveal the presence of an excess of sources well outside the core of the cluster where several RS CVn binaries have already been found. We have also analyzed a publicly available Chandra ACIS-I observation performed on January 24-25th, 2000, to improve the XMM-Newton source positions and to search for source intensity variations between the two data sets. 63 XMM-Newton sources have a Chandra counterpart, and 15 sources within the half-mass radius have shown time variability. Overall, the general properties of the faint X-ray sources in ω Cen suggest that they are predominantly CVs and active binaries (RS CVn or BY Dra).},

	abstract = {Until recently, symbiotic binary systems in which a white dwarf accretes from a red giant were thought to be mainly a soft X-ray population. Here we describe the detection with the X-ray Telescope (XRT) on the Swift satellite of nine white dwarf symbiotics that were not previously known to be X-ray sources and one that had previously been detected as a supersoft X-ray source. The nine new X-ray detections were the result of a survey of 41 symbiotic stars, and they increase the number of symbiotic stars known to be X-ray sources by approximately 30\%. The Swift/XRT telescope detected all of the new X-ray sources at energies greater than 2 keV. Their X-ray spectra are consistent with thermal emission and fall naturally into three distinct groups. The first group contains those sources with a single, highly absorbed hard component that we identify as probably coming from an accretion-disk boundary layer. The second group is composed of those sources with a single, soft X-ray spectral component that probably originates in a region where low-velocity shocks produce X-ray emission, i.e., a colliding-wind region. The third group consists of those sources with both hard and soft X-ray spectral components. We also find that unlike in the optical, where rapid, stochastic brightness variations from the accretion disk typically are not seen, detectable UV flickering is a common property of symbiotic stars. Supporting our physical interpretation of the two X-ray spectral components, simultaneous Swift UV photometry shows that symbiotic stars with harder X-ray emission tend to have stronger UV flickering, which is usually associated with accretion through a disk. To place these new observations in the context of previous work on X-ray emission from symbiotic stars, we modified and extended the α/β/γ classification scheme for symbiotic-star X-ray spectra that was introduced by Muerset et al. based upon observations with the ROSAT satellite, to include a new δ classification for sources with hard X-ray emission from the innermost accretion region. Because we have identified the elusive accretion component in the emission from a sample of symbiotic stars, our results have implications for the understanding of wind-fed mass transfer in wide binaries, and the accretion rate in one class of candidate progenitors of type Ia supernovae.

This thesis consists of several surveys to search for binary stars and to estimate the frequencies of binary populations in globular clusters. The motivations for these searches are that 1) binary populations (even with a fraction as small as 3\%) dominate the dynamical evolution of a globular cluster by producing a tremendous amount of energy through stellar encounters; 2) binary stars provide important information for understanding several apparently different phenomena such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and X-ray sources.

Two different techniques were employed in our surveys. The first survey is based on radial velocities obtained using the Norris Multi-fiber Spectrograph on the Palomar 200 inch telescope. We discovered 5 spectroscopic binary candidates among a total of 65 stars in the globular cluster NGC 5053. A total of 223 velocities were obtained for these 65 stars over a timespan of 3 years with a typical velocity error per measurement of 3 kms[...]. With detailed computer simulations we calculated the fraction of binaries which might have been missed in our detection sample due to unfavourable binary orbital configurations. Thus, we derived a binary frequency of 19-26\% depending on the adopted period distribution function and orbital eccentricities.

The second part of this thesis utilized a different technique -- the analysis of time series photometry. This method is efficient in searching for eclipsing binaries with periods of a few days, as demonstrated in our surveys in the two globular clusters M 71 and M 5. We discovered a total of 11 eclipsing binaries in the clusters, with periods of 0.3-0.7 days. All variables are main-sequence stars except one in M 5, which is a possible blue straggler. Their light curves indicate that one variable in M 71 and one in M 5 are detached or semi-detached eclipsing binaries; the rest of the 11 systems are W UMa type contact binaries. Based on a simple model of the evolution of contact binaries from initially detached short-period binaries, we estimated a lower limit of 1.3\% on the frequency of primordial binaries in M 71 with initial orbital periods of 2.5-5 days. This implies that the primordial binary frequency is 22\% assuming a flat logarithmic period distribution. This frequency is for binaries with initial periods shorter than 800 years since any longer-period binaries would have been disrupted over the lifetime of the cluster. A similar calculation was done in M 5. Adopting a flat logarithmic period distribution and a contact binary lifetime of 3 Gyr, we estimated an overall primordial binary frequency of [...]\% for systems with periods of 2.5 days to 550 yrs. The discovery of 11 short-period main-sequence eclipsing binaries for the first time provides strong physical evidence which supports the scenario that some blue stragglers are formed by mass transfer and mergers in short-period main-sequence binary systems.},

Attention is given to two possible explanations for this difference: (1) a dependence of the mass transfer rate on the secondary mass in low mass X-ray binaries, and (2) a dependence of the mass transfer rate on metallicity. The first explanation requires a mass transfer rate increase by a factor of about 5 between secondary masses of about 0.8 and 0.9 solar masses. Such a steep increase is difficult to reconcile with the observed flatness of the X-ray luminosity distribution.},

	abstract = {The stellar encounter rate Γ has been shown to be strongly correlated with the number of X-ray binaries in globular clusters (GCs) and also to the number of radio pulsars. However, the pulsar populations in diﬀerent GCs show remarkably diﬀerent characteristics: in some GCs the population is dominated by binary systems, in others by single pulsars and exotic systems that result from exchange encounters. In this paper, we describe a second dynamical parameter for GCs, the encounter rate for a single binary, γ. We ﬁnd that this parameter provides a good characterization of the diﬀerences between the pulsar populations of diﬀerent GCs. The higher γ is for any particular GC, the more isolated pulsars and products of exchange interactions are observed. Furthermore, we also ﬁnd that slow and “young” pulsars are found almost exclusively in clusters with a high γ; this suggests that these kinds of objects are formed by the disruption of X-ray binaries, thus halting the recycling of a previously dead neutron star. We discuss the implications of this for the nature of young pulsars and for the formation of neutron stars in GCs.},
